# NCS-Quizr
Making Quiz conduction faster, engaging.

# Why 

  ## Problems we were facing:
  1. Our events are heavily time constraint, and interactions like quizzes with audience takes a lot 
  of time which reduces the chances of conducting all the portions of the event in time.
  2. Ambiguity between the audience, i.e, who got the answer first.
  3. We could have more engagements if the quizzes were more gamified, but handling a leaderboard
     is a task on its own.
  4. Management  and conduction of quizzes are a tough task.

  Quizr is the official quizing app of NCS,developed for easy conduction of quizzes, feedbacks in events such   as our Orientation programs, workshops , etc. 
  This is super convinient to use even in events with less internet connectivity, everything is real-time.
  Reduces ambiguity between the players and reduces over-all time for conducting quizzes when the 
  event is heavily time-constrained.
  A realtime leaderboard gamifies the whole quiz and admin panel adds control over the quizzes.
